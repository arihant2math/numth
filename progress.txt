totally transferred:
	numth,
		including:
		Rational class
		mod_inverse
		mod_power
		jacobi
	primality

next:
	add sqrt to numth
	work on factorization module
	add Mod class to numth
	add other modular functions to numth
	expand Mod class to include order, etc
	sums of squares
	add Quadratic class to numth
	add std approx to numth
	add ContinuedFraction class
	factorization in rings of integers?
