totally transferred:
	numth,
		including:
		mod_inverse
		mod_power
		jacobi
	primality
	polynomial
	rational

next:
	work on factorization module
	add modular classes
	add other modular functions to numth
	tests
	expand Mod class to include order, etc
	sums of squares
	add Quadratic class to numth
	add ContinuedFraction class
	factorization in rings of integers?
